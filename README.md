# Database Creation and Data Exploration

![](creative_databse.png)

## Project Overview
   This is a personal, demo project aimed at putting my knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL) to test. It is aimed at the creation of a database for a small scale business that specializes in sales of day to day items like baby food, stationeries and beverages. Tasks such as adding a new customer to the database after creation, and analysing sales are carried out to aid decision making.

## Data Source
  It's a mock data created by me using MySQL server.

  ## Tools
  - MySQL server
  - The important syntax used includes: Create, Use, Insert, Update, and Joins.
